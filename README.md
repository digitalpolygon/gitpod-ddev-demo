# Gitpod + DDEV + JetBrains + Drupal Demo

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/digitalpolygon/gitpod-ddev-demo)

Sample project that showcases what a project might look like when run through Gitpod. Its aim is to demonstrate a
solution that combines Gitpod, DDEV, JetBrains IDEs, and Drupal (plus multisite).

## Outstanding Issues

- Breadcrumb bar does not display through Gateway https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CWM-621/Missing-breadcrumbs-feature-on-the-client
- Symfony Support plugin does not want to install (this is nearly a showstopper as Symfony files in editor lose tons of UI markup and interactivity).
